# Smart Task Manager

This is a simple yet functional task management web application built using **React** for the frontend and **Firebase Firestore** for the backend.

## Why React and Firebase?

I chose React because I have prior experience working with it, which allows me to quickly build responsive, component-based user interfaces. For the backend, I used Firebase Firestore as it provides a flexible, real-time NoSQL cloud database that's easy to integrate with React and requires minimal backend setup.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete  
- View tasks by selected date  
- Automatically sync with Firebase Firestore  
- Responsive UI built with React components

## React Components

The application is modular and composed of the following key components:

- **App.js** – Main component that brings everything together and manages state and layout  
- **Header.js** – Displays the app title, progress bar for the day, and number of tasks completed vs total  
- **CalendarPanel.js** – Lets users select a date to view tasks for that specific day  
- **TaskForm.js** – A form to add new tasks including title, optional description, and deadline  
- **TaskList.js** – Lists all tasks for the selected date and allows marking them complete or deleting  
- **TodayTaskWidget.js** – Provides a quick overview of today’s tasks, separated from the main task list  
- **TaskService.js** – A utility module that handles all Firebase Firestore interactions (CRUD operations)

## Room for Improvement

A major improvement could be implementing user authentication (login/signup), allowing users to create a personalized task management experience. Each user could then have their own Firestore collection of tasks.

## Database Schema (Firestore)

Each task is stored as a document in the Firestore collection, with the following fields:

| Field       | Type    | Description                                          |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| title       | String  | The title of the task (required)                     |
| description | String  | Additional info about the task (optional)           |
| completed   | Boolean | Whether the task is complete or not                 |
| date        | String  | The date the task is associated with (YYYY-MM-DD)   |
| deadline    | String  | Optional deadline for the task                      |

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
### 3. Set up Firebase

- Create a project in Firebase Console
- Enable Firestore
- Create a .env file in the root directory with your Firebase config:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```
### 4. Run the app
```
npm start
```
The app will run at http://localhost:3000
## Assumptions Made

- One user uses the app at a time (no multi-user support)
- Tasks are tied to a specific date
- Users do not require task reminders or push notifications yet
- Firestore collections are public (no auth rules applied)

## Version Control

The project is managed using Git, and all code is pushed to a public GitHub repository for version tracking and collaboration.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Create React App)  
- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Future Enhancements

- User login/signup (Firebase Auth)  
- Mobile responsiveness  
- Task analytics (completed vs pending)  
- Calendar view for tasks  
- Task reminder notifications  
- Dark mode toggle
